The focus of Yang Zhang’s research is the **fundamental dynamics of atmospheric circulations**, including <u>eddy-mean flow interactions in various climate variabilities and regional weather extremes</u>, <u>mechanisms of extratropical air-sea interactions</u> and <u>planetary waves connecting polar regions and midlatitudes</u>.

The interaction between atmospheric eddies and the atmospheric general circulation is one of the main causes of climate change and weather extremes. The highly nonlinearity and the complex multi-scale processes of the atmospheric motion challenges our understanding of the eddy-mean flow interaction. Zhang Yang's research developed **the new "finite amplitude wave activity" framework** to tackle the caveat of existing dynamical theories which are mostly based on quasi-linear assumptions, and discovered **the mechanism of the multi-scale interaction** between atmospheric <u>high frequency</u>, <u>low frequency</u> eddies and <u>atmospheric circulation</u> to maintain the persistent climate anomalies. 

In the past 5 years, Zhang Yang has published 30 academic papers, including 25 articles published in **JAS, JCL, GRL, BAMS** and other first-class SCI journals. Her work was selected as the Research Spotlight of the American Geophysical Union and reported in its newsletter Eos.org as helping to improve predictions of atmospheric circulation. Part of her research work has been applied to the climate prediction in the National Climate Center of China, and won the Award of the 13th Five-Year Outstanding Meteorological Science and Technology.
